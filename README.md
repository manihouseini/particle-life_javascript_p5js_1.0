# Particle Life
this is a basic particle life simulation. 
the first slider is the distance that the particles will try to avoid each other
the second slider is the distance they can see and push and pull each other
and the third slider is the whole force coefficient. 
move the mouse to the edges and use left mouse button to move around.
the width and hight of the canvas changes based on the viewport so use f11 to go fullscreen. then f5 to reload.
